My husband and I are renting but we have also been planning on saving for a down payment and buying our own house. It would be better just because our landlord increases the rent each year and after almost 8 years of renting it just doesn't seem worth it. A mortgage would be more stable and with a fixed rate we wouldn't have to worry about it fluctuating like the rent does. I think it would give both of us peace of mind knowing that one of our main costs wasn't constantly going up each year.  My definition of success would be having a house of our own and paying less each month in bills so we would be able to save more.
